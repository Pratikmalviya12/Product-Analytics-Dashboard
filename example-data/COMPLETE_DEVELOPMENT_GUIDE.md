# üìö Detailed Development Guidelines

## üèóÔ∏è Core Development Principles

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
Each component should have one clear purpose and responsibility. Avoid creating components that handle multiple unrelated concerns like data management, UI rendering, and business logic all in one place. Instead, separate these concerns into focused, reusable pieces.

### 2. **Composition Over Inheritance**
Build complex components by combining simpler components rather than extending base classes. This approach promotes reusability and makes components easier to test and maintain. Focus on creating small, focused components that can be composed together.

### 3. **Immutable Data Patterns**
Always treat state as immutable. Never directly modify existing state objects or arrays. Instead, create new objects with the desired changes. This prevents unexpected side effects and makes state changes predictable and easier to debug.

### 4. **Declarative Programming**
Write code that describes what should happen rather than how it should happen. Focus on the desired outcome and let the framework handle the implementation details. This makes code more readable and maintainable.

### 5. **Separation of Concerns**
Keep business logic separate from presentation logic. Data fetching, state management, and UI rendering should be handled by different layers of your application. This makes each piece easier to test and modify independently.

---

## üîß TypeScript Rules & Practices

### 1. **Strict Type Definitions**
Always define proper interfaces for your data structures. Avoid using the 'any' type as it defeats the purpose of TypeScript. Create specific types for different data shapes and use union types for values that can be one of several specific options.

### 2. **Generic Type Safety**
Use generics to create reusable type-safe functions and components. This allows you to maintain type safety while creating flexible, reusable code that can work with different data types.

### 3. **Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing**
Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators to safely access nested properties and provide default values. This prevents runtime errors when dealing with potentially undefined or null values.

### 4. **Type Guards and Assertions**
Create type guard functions to safely check types at runtime. Avoid type assertions unless absolutely necessary, and when you do use them, ensure they're backed by proper validation.

### 5. **Interface Segregation**
Create small, focused interfaces rather than large ones with many optional properties. This makes your types more specific and helps catch errors at compile time.

---

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization Guidelines

### 1. **React.memo for Expensive Components**
Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components that receive the same props. This is especially important for chart components and other computationally expensive UI elements.

### 2. **useMemo for Expensive Calculations**
Cache the results of expensive calculations using useMemo. This prevents recalculating the same values on every render, especially important for data processing and chart calculations.

### 3. **useCallback for Event Handlers**
Wrap event handlers in useCallback to maintain stable function references. This prevents child components from re-rendering unnecessarily when they receive these functions as props.

### 4. **Lazy Loading for Large Components**
Use React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when needed. This reduces the initial bundle size and improves page load times, especially for features that aren't immediately visible.

### 5. **Efficient Data Processing**
Use efficient algorithms and data structures. Prefer Map and Set over arrays for lookups, batch DOM updates, and avoid processing data during render cycles.

### 6. **Bundle Optimization**
Minimize bundle size by importing only what you need, using tree shaking, and splitting code into smaller chunks. Regularly analyze your bundle to identify and remove unused dependencies.

---

## üîí Security Precautions

### 1. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
Always validate and sanitize user inputs. Check data types, ranges, and formats before processing. Never trust data from external sources, including user inputs and API responses.

### 2. **Safe JSON Parsing**
Wrap JSON parsing in try-catch blocks and validate the structure of parsed data. Don't assume that JSON from external sources will have the expected format.

### 3. **Environment Variable Protection**
Never expose sensitive information like API keys or secrets in client-side code. Use environment variables appropriately and validate their presence without exposing their values.

### 4. **XSS Prevention**
Avoid using dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless absolutely necessary. When you must use it, sanitize the content first. Prefer React's automatic escaping for text content.

### 5. **Secure File Handling**
When handling file uploads, validate file types, sizes, and content. Never execute or directly display user-uploaded content without proper validation and sanitization.

### 6. **API Security**
Implement proper authentication and authorization for API calls. Use HTTPS for all external communications and validate responses before processing them.

---

## üé® Component Design Principles

### 1. **Consistent Props Interface**
Establish consistent patterns for component props. Use standard prop names and structures across similar components to make the API predictable and easy to learn.

### 2. **Compound Component Pattern**
For complex components, use the compound component pattern to provide flexibility while maintaining good defaults. This allows users to compose components as needed while keeping the API intuitive.

### 3. **Render Props for Flexibility**
Use render props or children as functions to provide maximum flexibility for how components display their content. This allows for customization without requiring multiple component variants.

### 4. **Default Props and Optional Properties**
Provide sensible defaults for optional props to reduce the burden on consumers. Make required props explicit and optional props truly optional.

### 5. **Component Composition**
Design components to work well together. Create small, focused components that can be combined to build more complex interfaces rather than monolithic components.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è State Management Best Practices

### 1. **Zustand Store Structure**
Organize your Zustand store with clear sections for different types of state. Separate data state, UI state, configuration, and actions into logical groups for better maintainability.

### 2. **State Normalization**
Normalize complex state structures to avoid deep nesting and make updates more efficient. Use lookup tables (objects with IDs as keys) for collections of items.

### 3. **Optimistic Updates**
Implement optimistic updates for better user experience. Update the UI immediately and handle failures gracefully by reverting changes if operations fail.

### 4. **Derived State**
Use selectors and computed properties for derived state rather than storing calculated values. This ensures consistency and reduces the chance of state getting out of sync.

### 5. **State Persistence**
Implement proper state persistence for user preferences and important data. Handle edge cases like storage quota exceeded and corrupted data gracefully.

---

## üö® Error Handling & Validation

### 1. **Error Boundaries**
Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully. Provide meaningful fallback UI and logging for debugging purposes.

### 2. **Async Error Handling**
Properly handle errors in async operations. Provide user feedback for failed operations and implement retry mechanisms where appropriate.

### 3. **Input Validation Schemas**
Create comprehensive validation schemas for data inputs. Validate data shape, types, ranges, and business rules consistently across your application.

### 4. **Graceful Degradation**
Design your application to degrade gracefully when non-critical features fail. Ensure core functionality remains available even when auxiliary features encounter errors.

### 5. **Error Reporting**
Implement proper error reporting and logging for production environments. Collect enough information for debugging while respecting user privacy.

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Requirements

### 1. **ARIA Labels & Roles**
Implement proper ARIA attributes to make your application accessible to screen readers. Use semantic HTML elements and enhance them with ARIA when necessary.

### 2. **Keyboard Navigation**
Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard. Implement proper tab order, focus management, and keyboard shortcuts for power users.

### 3. **Screen Reader Support**
Design with screen readers in mind. Provide descriptive text for images, proper headings hierarchy, and announcements for dynamic content changes.

### 4. **Color and Contrast**
Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios and don't rely solely on color to convey information. Support high contrast modes and consider color blindness.

### 5. **Focus Management**
Implement proper focus management, especially in dynamic interfaces. Ensure focus moves logically and is always visible to users.

---

## üß™ Testing Strategies

### 1. **Unit Testing with Jest & React Testing Library**
Write comprehensive unit tests for components focusing on behavior rather than implementation details. Test user interactions and various prop combinations.

### 2. **Integration Testing**
Create integration tests that verify different parts of your application work together correctly. Focus on user workflows and data flow between components.

### 3. **Performance Testing**
Monitor and test performance regularly. Set performance budgets and test with realistic data volumes to ensure your application scales well.

### 4. **Accessibility Testing**
Include accessibility testing in your testing strategy. Use automated tools and manual testing to ensure your application meets accessibility standards.

### 5. **Visual Regression Testing**
Implement visual regression testing to catch unintended UI changes. This is especially important for applications with complex visual components.

---

## üìñ Documentation Standards

### 1. **JSDoc Comments**
Write comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public functions and components. Include parameter descriptions, return values, and usage examples.

### 2. **README Structure**
Maintain clear README files with consistent structure. Include purpose, installation, usage examples, API documentation, and contribution guidelines.

### 3. **Component Documentation**
Document component APIs, props, and usage patterns. Include accessibility considerations and performance notes where relevant.

### 4. **Architecture Documentation**
Maintain high-level architecture documentation that explains how different parts of the application work together and key design decisions.

### 5. **Change Documentation**
Keep clear changelogs and migration guides. Document breaking changes and provide upgrade paths for consumers of your components.

---

## üöÄ Deployment & Production Guidelines

### 1. **Environment Configuration**
Set up proper environment configuration for different deployment stages. Keep sensitive configuration separate and validate environment variables.

### 2. **Build Optimization**
Configure your build process for optimal performance. Use code splitting, tree shaking, and other optimization techniques to minimize bundle size.

### 3. **Error Monitoring**
Implement comprehensive error monitoring and alerting for production environments. Set up logging and monitoring to quickly identify and resolve issues.

### 4. **Performance Monitoring**
Monitor application performance in production. Track key metrics like page load times, user interactions, and resource usage.

### 5. **Security Headers**
Configure proper security headers and policies. Implement Content Security Policy, HTTPS enforcement, and other security best practices.

### 6. **Rollback Strategies**
Implement safe deployment strategies with easy rollback options. Use feature flags and gradual rollouts to minimize risk of introducing bugs.
