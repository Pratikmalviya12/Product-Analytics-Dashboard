### Method 2: Use Real-Time Data Only

If you just want to see live tracking without historical data:

#### Check Real-Time Analytics

2. Navigate to **Reports > Realtime**
3. Open your dashboard: http://localhost:5173/
4. Interact with your dashboard (change filters, click charts)
5. Watch the real-time data in GA4

#### What You'll See
- Active users on your site
- Page views as you navigate
- Events as you interact with dashboard
- Geographic data of visitors
- Device and browser information

### Method 3: Import CSV Data

For immediate testing with real-looking data:

#### Using the CSV Import Feature

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Real Data Access**

### If GA4 Data API Setup Fails:
```
Common Issues:
✅ Check: Service account has Analytics access
✅ Check: Property ID is correct (12018849689)
✅ Check: Google Analytics Data API is enabled
✅ Check: JSON file is valid and downloaded correctly
```

### If No Real-Time Data Appears:
```
Check:
✅ GA4 tag is loading (check browser console)
✅ Events are being sent (F12 > Network tab)
✅ Ad blockers are disabled
✅ Using HTTPS or localhost
```

## 🎉 **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# Check if your development server is running
# Should show: http://localhost:5173/

# Test GA4 integration
curl -I http://localhost:5173/ga4-test.html
```
